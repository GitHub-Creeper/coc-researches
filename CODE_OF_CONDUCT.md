# Community Code of Conduct
This repository is governed by the Mozilla team, so follow their guidelines. Check out [MOZILLA_GUIDELINES.md](MOZILLA_GUIDELINES.md). This fork right here is just a research and experiment with my Code of Conduct
Anyway, this project adopted two additional Code of Conduct.
____________________________________________________________________________________________
This project has adopted the Cat Creeper's Open-Source Code of Conduct.

- Extended and Descriptive Code of Conduct: [community_coc.md](code_of_conducts/official_coc/community_coc.md)
- Short and StraightForward Code of Conduct: [short_community_coc.md](code_of_conducts/short_coc/short_community_coc.md)
Note: These two code of conduct is the same. But I have two versions for you to read. You can read whatever you like. And the short code of conduct is the adapted Contributor Covenant.

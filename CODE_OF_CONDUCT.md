# Community Code of Conduct
The Mozilla team governs this repository, so follow their guidelines. Check out [MOZILLA_GUIDELINES.md](MOZILLA_GUIDELINES.md). This fork right here is just a research and experiment with my Code of Conduct
Anyway, this project adopted two additional Code of Conduct.
____________________________________________________________________________________________
This project has adopted the Cat Creeper's Open-Source Code of Conduct.

- Extended and Descriptive Code of Conduct: [community_coc.md](code_of_conducts/official_coc) and check out the latest version.
- Short and StraightForward Code of Conduct: [short_community_coc.md](code_of_conducts/short_coc) and check out the latest version.

Note: These two Code of Conducts are the same. But I have two versions for you to read. You can read whatever you like. And the short Code of Conduct is the adapted Contributor Covenant.

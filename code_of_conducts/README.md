These are releases of my example Code of Conduct right for you to adapt, or I'll use it one day.

Just an example of many examples out there. If ypu don't like it in anyway, feel free to use other examples or the Contributor Covenant at any time and place. 

The repository itself is a fork of a Mozilla research lab to be my personal and releases versions.

I use incremental versioning. Every changes I make will increase the decimal point by 1. Previous version changes won't be made directly in that old version. Instead, it will be increment to a new version instead. So documents are always permanent.

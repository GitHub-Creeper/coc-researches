These are releases of my example Code of Conduct right for you to adapt, or I'll use it one day.

The repository itself is a fork of a Mozilla research lab to be my personal and releases versions.

I use incremental versioning. Every changes I make will increase the decimal point by 1. Previous version changes won't be made directly in that old version. Instead, it will be increment to a new version instead. So documents are always permanent.

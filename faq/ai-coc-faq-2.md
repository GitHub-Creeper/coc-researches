## Code of Conduct FAQ

**What is a Code of Conduct?**

A Code of Conduct (CoC) is a set of guidelines that outlines expected behavior within a community, event, or online space. It establishes a foundation of respect, safety, and inclusion for everyone involved.

**Why is a Code of Conduct important?**

A CoC helps create a positive and productive environment for everyone. It discourages harassment, discrimination, and other forms of unacceptable behavior. It also provides a clear process for reporting and addressing any issues that may arise.

**Who should follow the Code of Conduct?**

Everyone participating in the community, event, or online space is expected to follow the CoC. This includes organizers, attendees, speakers, members, and guests.

**What if I witness someone violating the Code of Conduct?**

Most CoCs will have a reporting process outlined. This may involve contacting a designated point person, reporting the incident through an online form, or sending an email.

**What happens if I violate the Code of Conduct?**

Possible consequences for violating the CoC can vary depending on the severity of the offense.  They may include warnings, removal from the event or community, or even legal action.

**Where can I find the Code of Conduct?**

The CoC should be readily available for everyone. It's  often found on the event website, online community forum, or displayed prominently at physical events. 

**I disagree with something in the Code of Conduct.  Can I provide feedback?**

Absolutely!  Many communities welcome suggestions for improvement to their CoC.  There may be designated channels for submitting feedback, or you can reach out to the organizers directly. 

**Isn't a Code of Conduct just common sense?**

While many CoC principles  align with common courtesy,  having a  formal document helps set clear expectations and provides a recourse mechanism for addressing  unacceptable behavior.

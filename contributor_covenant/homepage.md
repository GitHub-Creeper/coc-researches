A Code of Conduct for Open Source Communities
---------------------------------------------

Participating in open source is often a highly collaborative experience. We’re encouraged to create in public view, and we’re incentivized to welcome contributions of all kinds from people around the world. This makes the practice of open source as much social as it is technical.

Some open source projects attract enough contributors that a community forms. A healthy open source community centers the shared values and norms of its members. While not all of these values are exactly the same from community to community, there is a set of _core values and norms_ that are essential in a just and equitable software commons.

Contributor Covenant is a code of conduct that you can adapt to express both these fundamental shared values, and the special norms and values that distinguish your own community.

Adopting Contributor Covenant helps makes your community’s values explicit, and signals your commitment to creating a welcoming and safe environment for everyone.

Before You Adopt Contributor Covenant
-------------------------------------

It’s important to understand that simply adopting Contributor Covenant will not prevent conflict or toxicity in your community.

As a leader you are responsible for the safe, fair, and transparent enforcement of your community’s code of conduct. A code of conduct without such enforcement sends a false signal that a community is welcoming and inclusive, which can have a disastrous impact on marginalized or otherwise vulnerable people.

Before you decide to adopt Contributor Covenant, take the time to discuss enforcement with other trusted members of your community. Thoroughly read the Enforcement Guidelines section of the document. If the suggested actions and consequences don’t suit the context of your community, consider moving this section to another document (such as an FAQ or ‘How to Report’ page) and adapting it to your needs.

How to Adopt Contributor Covenant
---------------------------------

Your code of conduct should be easy to locate, whether as page on your community’s website or a CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT.md file in the root directory of your project’s repository.

_You must add a contact method to the placeholder in the document_ so that people know how to report violations.

If you are using a README file in your source code repository, you can display a badge like this one ![Contributor Covenant Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg).

For markdown files, use this code:

    [![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)](code_of_conduct.md)
    

For reStructuredText files, place `|Contributor Covenant|` where you would like the badge and add this to the bottom of the file:

    
    .. |Contributor Covenant| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg
       :target: code_of_conduct.md

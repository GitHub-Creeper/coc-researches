It applies to our open-source project. We must adhere to the guidelines outlined in this Code of Conduct. Any violations will result in enforcement action. And I have understood this Code of Conduct and what does this mean? how does it work? So instead of excuses, if you don't violate our Code of Conduct, nothing's not gonna happen to you. So please comply; do not try to find loopholes. Feel free to open an issue if you have any questions or concerns.

I did not formally adopt the Contributor Covenant. But their Code of Conduct is free to use and share. The only condition is you have to proper credit and attribute them. But if you'd like, you should adopt the Contributor Covenant. They also have resources and support for the Code of Conduct. And I truly respect their work and know they are working all day to build this Code of Conduct. Even I struggled to build my own Code of Conduct although I have AI to help me out.

And thank you for Contributor Covenant to write this amazing Code of Conduct.

And also I did the modifications and implemented minor changes. They did the main work. Go check their link above to learn more!

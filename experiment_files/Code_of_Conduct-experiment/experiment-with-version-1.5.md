# Cat Creeper’s Open-Source Code of Conduct

## Introduction

Our community, your community, or any other community in whatever place has one same thing: A community with lots of people - a highly collaborative and contributing experience for everyone. People welcome, help, collaborate, talking to each other. But behind those very nice environments, unfriendly folks just hide themselves somewhere we don't know or don't think of, or people are kind, for real but they just get confused about what kind of face and treat people want to feel welcome.

A Code of Conduct is a set of guidelines that outlines what we expect from everyone participating in our open-source projects as well as reporting unacceptable behavior. By adopting a Code of Conduct. Communities make sure everyone meets each other with appropriate behavior. Therefore, ensures your community is a safe, inclusive, and inspiring environment.

When adhere to a Code of Conduct, you are upholding the standards of this Code of Conduct and taking responsibility for your actions.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of promoting an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community, we as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to participate in our community a discrimination-free and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of background, age, body size, skin tone and color, health status and sickness, relationships include family and friendships, disability whether visible or not, ethnicity, ability, sex characteristics, native language, gender, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, tribe, geographic location, religion, politics, sexual identity and orientation or any other dimension of diversity.

## Our Standards

First off, we expect people to treat people with respect and professionalism. So that people feel welcome to contribute to this project, and share interests and ideas.

The following guidelines are not strict or fast rules, it’s a foundation to guide everyone on how to welcome members in this community.

### *Best practices to maintain a positive community*

Participating in open-source communities is a highly collaborative experience. But I hope people will treat others will professionalism and being respectful of different perspectives. So we really encourages to follow these guidelines
to make people feel valued.

* **Be welcoming:** Keep your friendliness and make new users join this community feel welcome. So the community feels safe and welcome to contribute.
* **Open your mind:** Open your feelings, and mindfully listen to others’ opinions no matter how much experience they have. They need a place under the sunlight just like yours. Don’t be selfish and think only about you. Decide what is best for the community.
* **Be respectful:** Treat everyone like what you’d like to be treated. Kindness and respect are what others want (I guess most of everyone). Everyone is human, they are the same in this world, so being rude to them is like being rude to yourself. Plus, it’s also a key to a collaborative atmosphere.
* **Be honest and trustworthy:** Be honest and transparent in all communications and actions. Do not mislead our users by sharing falsifying information or misrepresenting the organization and get them to believe that. Become a person that everyone fully trusts. 
* **Accountability:** Be responsible for your actions and decisions. Give someone who was affected by your mistake(s) a sincere apology. Acknowledge and learn from the experience.
* **Compliance:** Adhere to all applicable laws, regulations, and organizational policies. If you use third-party platforms, they have their rights so we must adhere to them.
* **Safety and Security:** Promote a safe and secure environment for all members. Don’t share any type of malicious things. This includes but is not limited to: viruses, malware, trojans, loggers, spyware, stealers, or any unsafe links. Make this a safe and trustable community.

### *Bad and unacceptable behavior that affects people*

This list shows down bad behaviors you should avoid and cause disruption, annoyances or even break people's mental health. So I hope mentioning those helps you avoid those unacceptable terms as well as when you can report to us
and that person or group can get their well-deserved punishment.

* **Discrimination:** Any form of discrimination based on any protected classes and characteristics, including those mentioned in Our Pledge section. Treat people fair, they are like you too.
* **Inappropriate:** The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind. This is utterly disgusting.
* **Attacks:** Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks. This can cause serious mental health damage.
* **Stalking:** Stalk, and following others, especially for malicious and harmful purposes is prohibited. This makes people feel unsafe and harmed.
* **Harassment:** Any form of harassment, including but not limited to sexual harassment, bullying, and intimidation publicly or privately. This is annoying and may hurt the affected person’s mental health.
* **Conflict of Interest:** Engaging in activities that create a conflict of interest or compromise objectivity. 
* **Violence and Threats:** Any act of hate speech, violence, threat, or aggressive behavior will not be tolerated. People’s feelings are like an ocean, and it’s easy to just throw a rock in the ocean, but you don’t know how deep the rock goes. But if you can’t be kind, be quiet…
* **Privacy Risk:** Reveal anyone’s sensitive information such as email or home address, including yours online or someone you don’t trust could create huge privacy risks.
* **Encourage Bad Behavior:** Encouraging or provoking unacceptable behavior will be treated as if you committed the behavior yourself, resulting in identical consequences.
* **Revenge:** Payback to anyone who reports you, your friend, or your party is unacceptable. When you make mistakes, it's good to acknowledge them. We will not tolerate those who don't accept their mistakes, instead harm others.
* **Report Falsely:** Although no revenge to someone report you in good faith, don't try to report innocent people for the intended to harm people or destroy people's life and make people get banned falsely.
* **Other conducts:** Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting. This place is experienced and should be treated like such.

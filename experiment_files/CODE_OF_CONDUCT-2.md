# Cat Creeper’s Open-Source Code of Conduct
## 1. What Code of Conduct aims to
### 1.1. Purpose of Code of Conduct
This Code of Conduct outlines what we expect from everyone participating in our open-source projects and reporting unacceptable behavior. It's designed to ensure a safe, inclusive, and inspiring environment where everyone feels welcome to contribute. Any Code of Conduct's violations might get their deserved punishment.
### 1.2. Responsibility for adhering to the Code of Conduct.
When joining this community, you agree to follow our Code of Conduct. Although it uses GitHub Community Code of Conduct and Contributor Covenant – a product they’ve worked hard for communities, it doesn't mean you can violate the Code of Conduct. It applies to our open-source project. We must adhere to the guidelines outlined in this Code of Conduct. Any violations will result in enforcement action. And I have understood this Code of Conduct and what does this mean? how does it work? So instead of excuses, if you don't violate our Code of Conduct, nothing will happen to you. So please comply; do not try to find loopholes. Feel free to open an issue if you have any questions or concerns.
## 2. Overall Pledge
In the spirit of promoting an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to participate in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of background, age, body size, skin tone and color, relationships, disability whether visible or not, ethnicity, ability, sex characteristics, native language, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, geographic location, religion, politics or sexual identity and orientation.
## 3. Community Standards
First off, **Follow GitHub terms and policies.** When we use GitHub, we accept their Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and Community Guidelines. When we join a GitHub community or become a GitHub community, we adhere to the GitHub Community Code of Conduct. So violations could cause GitHub enforcement action and permanent removal of the community.

The following guidelines are not strict or fast rules, it’s a foundation to guide everyone on how to join the community and treat others.
### 3.1. The key to maintaining our positive community
* **Be welcoming:** Keep your friendliness and make new users join this community feel welcome. So the community feels safe and welcome to contribute.
* **Open your mind:** Open your feelings, and mindfully listen to others’ opinions no matter how much experience they have. They need a place under the sunlight just like yours. Don’t be selfish and think only about you. Decide what is best for the community.
* **Be respectful:** Treat everyone like what you’d like to be treated. Kindness and respect are what others want (I guess most of everyone). Everyone is human, they are the same in this world, so being rude to them is like being rude to yourself. Plus, it’s also a key to a collaborative atmosphere.
* **Be honest and trustworthy:** Be honest and transparent in all communications and actions. Do not mislead our users by sharing falsifying information or misrepresenting the organization and get them to believe that. Become a person that everyone fully trusts. 
* **Accountability:** Be responsible for your actions and decisions. Give someone who was affected by your mistake(s) a sincere apology. Acknowledge and learn from the experience.
* **Compliance:** Adhere to all applicable laws, regulations, and organizational policies. If you use third-party platforms, they have their rights so we must adhere to them.
* **Safety and Security:** Promote a safe and secure environment for all members. Don’t share any type of malicious things. This includes but is not limited to: viruses, malware, trojans, loggers, spyware, stealers, or any unsafe links. Make this a safe and trustable community.
### 3.2. Bad and unacceptable behavior that affects people
* **Discrimination:** Any form of discrimination based on race, gender, age, religion, sexual orientation, disability, or any other protected characteristic. Treat people fair, they are like you too.
* **Inappropriate:** The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind. This is utterly disgusting.
* **Attacks:** Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks. This can cause serious mental health damage.
* **Harassment:** Any form of harassment, including but not limited to sexual harassment, bullying, and intimidation publicly or privately. This is annoying and may hurt the affected person’s mental health.
* **Conflict of Interest:** Engaging in activities that create a conflict of interest or compromise objectivity. 
* **Violence and Threats:** Any act of hate speech, violence, threat, or aggressive behavior will not be tolerated. People’s feelings are like an ocean, and it’s easy to just throw a rock in the ocean, but you don’t know how deep the rock goes. But if you can’t be kind, be quiet…
* **Privacy Risk:** Reveal anyone’s sensitive information such as email or home address, including yours online or someone you don’t trust could create huge privacy risks.
* **Encourage Bad Behavior:** Encouraging or provoking unacceptable behavior will be treated as if you committed the behavior yourself, resulting in identical consequences.
* **Revenge:** Payback to anyone who reports you, your friend, or your party is unacceptable. When you make mistakes, it's good to acknowledge them. We will not tolerate those who don't accept their mistakes, instead harm others.
* **Other conducts:** Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting. This place is professional and should be treated like such.
## 4. Enforcement
### 4.1. What can you do?
**Report the problem when you see it.** Project maintainers and moderators are responsible for moderating our community. But to moderate easily, we rely on reports from our users. Any form of harassment, abuse, or any other kind of bad behavior may be reported at [INSERT CONTACT METHOD]. Additionally, reporting it to GitHub is a good idea. So that when we are busy, GitHub may do the work.

All concerns will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Please don’t waste your time or energy to tell them to stop their bad behavior.

Community leaders must respect the privacy and security of anyone reporting an incident.
### 4.2. Our Responsibilities
We are responsible for clearly defining and upholding our standards of acceptable behavior. We will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that is deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
We have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions not aligned with this Code of Conduct. We will also communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.
